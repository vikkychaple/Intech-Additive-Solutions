Explain a piece of code that you wrote which you are proud of? 
If you have not written any code, please write your favorite subject in engineering studies. 
We can go deep into that subject. 
Ans-
“Java” is my favorite subject in engineering because it helps me think 
 logically and understand how software works at a deeper level. 
 I enjoy learning about data structures, algorithms and java handles memory management compared to other languages. 
 I look forward to applying my java skills to real-world projects in the future.
